Embeddings Management for AI Ad Analysis System
Based on your database schema, I'll provide detailed instructions on how to handle embeddings for your AI advertising assistant.
Database Structure for Embeddings
You should create two new tables:

embeddings_store

id: UUID primary key
vector: Vector type (1536 dimensions for OpenAI embeddings)
text: Text that was embedded (for reference/debugging)
type: Type of content ('campaign', 'ad_group', 'keyword', 'chat_message')
source_id: Reference to the originating ID (campaign ID, message ID, etc.)
metadata: JSONB field for storing additional context
created_at: Timestamp


chat_embeddings

id: UUID primary key
chat_conversation_id: References chat_conversations table
embedding_id: References embeddings_store table
created_at: Timestamp
updated_at: Timestamp



This structure allows you to:

Store all embeddings in a central table
Create specific relationships for chat-based embeddings
Maintain metadata for contextual information

Embeddings Generation Process
1. Campaign & Ad Data Embeddings
Generate embeddings for advertising data during:

Initial data import
Campaign or ad group updates
Regular refresh intervals (weekly)

The process should:

Extract relevant data from campaign tables (advertiser_accounts, amazon_ad_reports, google_campaign_metrics)
Normalize and structure text by combining relevant fields:
CopyCampaign: {name}
Platform: {platform}
Description: {description}
Budget: {budget}
Key Metrics: RoAS {roas}, CPA {cpa}, CTR {ctr}

Generate embeddings through OpenAI API
Store in embeddings_store with type='campaign' and source_id linked to the campaign ID

2. Chat Message Embeddings
Generate embeddings for:

User queries in the chat_messages table
Conversations for semantic retrieval

The process should:

Extract the most recent messages (last 3-5) from a conversation
Combine messages with roles for context
Generate embedding using the same OpenAI model
Store in embeddings_store with type='chat_message'
Create relationship in chat_embeddings table

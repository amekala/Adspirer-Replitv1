# Amazon Ads API Integration Implementation Plan

## Overall Project Context

### The Amazon Advertising Challenge

Amazon sellers and brands face increasingly complex challenges managing their advertising campaigns. With multiple campaign types, constantly changing metrics, and competitive marketplaces, advertisers need both powerful analytics and actionable insights. Many struggle with:

- Understanding campaign performance across different products
- Optimizing budgets based on performance data
- Identifying trends and opportunities in complex datasets
- Making data-driven decisions quickly without technical expertise

### Our Solution

We're building a comprehensive web application for Amazon advertisers that:

1. **Web Application** - The central hub where advertisers:
   - Authenticate with Amazon through Login with Amazon (LWA)
   - Manage Amazon advertising profiles, campaigns, Ads groups, metrics in database
   - Generate API keys for each advertiser
   - Token refresh and API lifecycle management
   - Data synchronization and metric tracking

## The Advertiser Journey

1. **Onboarding & Authentication**
   - Advertiser signs up on our web application
   - Connects their Amazon Advertising account via LWA
   - Web app exchanges OAuth code for access tokens
   - System retrieves and stores profile data and campaign history

2. **Data Analysis & Management**
   - Web app provides dashboard analytics
   - Advertiser can view and manage campaigns through familiar interfaces
   - System regularly syncs campaign data to maintain current metrics

3. **API Integration**
   - Advertiser generates an API key from the web application
   - Can use the API key to integrate with their own tools and systems
   - Access campaign data and metrics programmatically

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication

1. Set up the TypeScript project with necessary dependencies
2. Implement API key validation against the database
3. Create the advertiser context
4. Establish secure database connections

### Phase 2: Data Access Layer

1. Create query functions for campaigns, metrics, and advertiser data
2. Implement smart filtering by advertiser ID on all queries
3. Build data aggregation utilities for metrics analysis
4. Add caching for frequently accessed data

### Phase 3: API Resources

1. Build campaign resources (listings, details, metrics)
2. Create campaign management endpoints
3. Implement budget adjustment endpoints with validation
4. Develop performance analysis endpoints

### Phase 4: Distribution & Documentation

1. Create comprehensive API documentation
2. Implement versioning strategy
3. Establish testing pipeline
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Value Proposition for Advertisers

Our web application delivers unique value to advertisers:

1. **Simplified Integration** - Easy authentication and API access
2. **Data Management** - Centralized campaign data and metrics
3. **Operational Efficiency** - Streamlined campaign management
4. **Secure Access** - Role-based permissions and API key management
5. **Real-time Sync** - Always up-to-date campaign data

## Security & Privacy Considerations

Throughout implementation, we'll maintain strict security practices:

1. **Data Isolation** - Each advertiser's data is strictly isolated
2. **Minimal Permissions** - Service accounts use row-level security
3. **Secure Authentication** - API keys are validated and never exposed
4. **No Data Storage** - All data is properly encrypted at rest

## Next Steps

The immediate actions will be:

1. Complete the web application's API key generation
2. Implement remaining API endpoints
3. Enhance the dashboard interface
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Begin testing with sample advertiser accounts

This implementation plan focuses on building a robust web application for Amazon advertisers with secure authentication, data management, and API access capabilities.

### Story and Insights

Your campaigns are generating a decent number of impressions and clicks, indicating that your ads are visible and engaging to some extent. However, the lack of conversions suggests a gap between interest and purchase.

#### Key Observations:

- **High CTR, No Conversions:** Despite a healthy CTR of around 3.5-3.6%, conversions are absent. This indicates that while users are interested enough to click, they are not completing purchases. 

- **Cost Efficiency:** The costs are relatively controlled, but without conversions, the return on ad spend (ROAS) remains at zero. This highlights the need for strategic adjustments to convert clicks into sales.

### Actionable Steps

1. **Keyword Refinement:** Focus on refining your keyword strategy. Ensure that the keywords are not only driving clicks but are also relevant to the purchasing intent.

2. **Product Page Optimization:** Review your product detail pages. Ensure they are compelling and provide all necessary information to convert interest into a purchase.

3. **Audience Targeting:** Re-evaluate your audience segments. Ensure you are reaching the right demographics who are more likely to convert.

4. **Bid Adjustments:** Consider adjusting bids on high-performing keywords to increase visibility and potential conversions.

By focusing on these areas, you can bridge the gap between clicks and conversions, ultimately improving your campaign performance. Let me know if there's a specific area you'd like to explore further!

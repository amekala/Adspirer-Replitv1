Understanding the Roles:

Chat LLM (openai.ts): This is your primary interaction engine. It handles conversation, understands user intent, calls tools (like campaign creation functions), and needs broad context about the user's business, brand, goals, products, and creative style to be helpful, conversational, and efficient.

SQL Builder LLM (sqlBuilder.ts): This is a specialized backend tool. Its job is to translate natural language questions specifically about performance data into SQL. It needs narrow, precise context: the database schema, the user ID (for filtering), potentially recent campaign IDs or timeframes mentioned in the chat history, and the user's specific data question.

2. Which LLM Benefits Most from Embeddings/RAG?

The Chat LLM (openai.ts) is the primary beneficiary of RAG using embeddings derived from your unstructured onboarding data (website content, product descriptions, creative examples/text, image descriptions).

Why? It needs to understand the semantics and nuances of the user's business beyond simple structured fields. This allows it to:

Generate relevant ad copy suggestions matching brand voice and product details.

Suggest appropriate campaign goals or targeting based on product descriptions or website content.

Answer qualitative questions ("What kind of images work well for my brand?").

Have more natural, informed conversations ("Okay, for your business selling [product from description], a good starting point for Google Ads would be...").

Pre-fill or suggest parameters for tool calls more intelligently.

The SQL Builder LLM (sqlBuilder.ts) benefits less directly from this type of RAG. Feeding it general website text or creative descriptions could confuse its primary task of generating precise SQL. It relies more on structured schema information and specific entities (like campaign IDs) potentially extracted from the chat history by the main application logic before calling the SQL builder.

3. Handling the Lack of pgvector

Since you have structured data in PostgreSQL but no pgvector, you need a separate place to store and query the text embeddings for the RAG component. Options:

Install pgvector: This is often the most recommended path if feasible. It keeps your structured and vector data together in the same managed database system. Check if your hosting provider supports it or if you can install extensions on your instance.


Filesystem/In-Memory (Not for Production): Libraries like FAISS allow saving index files locally. Suitable for testing/small scale but not robust or scalable for a production application.

Recommendation: Investigate installing the pgvector extension first. If that's truly not an option, evaluate managed vector database services based on ease of integration, cost, and performance needs. For the rest of this plan, I'll assume you'll choose a vector store solution (either pgvector or an alternative).

4. Phases to Introduce Embeddings for Campaign Questions (Focusing on Chat LLM)

Hereâ€™s how to integrate RAG, assuming you've chosen and set up your vector store:

Phase 1: Data Preparation & Embedding Storage (Backend during/after Onboarding)

Modify Onboarding Backend:

Step 1 (Website URL):

Trigger a backend job to scrape the text content from the user's website.

Chunking: Break the scraped text into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., by paragraphs or sections, aiming for ~100-500 tokens per chunk).

Embedding: For each chunk, call the OpenAI Embeddings API (e.g., text-embedding-3-small).

Storage: Store each text_chunk along with its embedding vector, user_id, and source_type: 'website' in your chosen vector store (or text_embeddings table if using pgvector).

Step 3 (Brand Identity - Logo/Images):

Store the logo URL in standard Postgres.

(Image Handling) Asynchronously, send the logo image (or URL) to a Vision-Language Model (VLM like GPT-4o Vision). Prompt it: "Describe this logo's style, colors, objects, and overall feeling."

Embed the resulting text description.

Store the description text and its embedding in the vector store with user_id and source_type: 'logo_description'.

Step 4 (Products/Services):

Store the structured uses_product_feed flag in standard Postgres.

If No Feed, take the product_service_description and key_selling_points text.

Chunk if necessary (though likely short enough).

Embed this text.

Store the text chunk(s) and embedding(s) in the vector store with user_id and source_type: 'product_description'.

Step 5 (Creative Examples):

Store file URLs/links/pasted text in standard Postgres.

Embed the pasted_text. Store text/embedding in vector store (source_type: 'creative_text').

(Image Handling) For uploaded images/videos (or linked ones if scrapable), asynchronously use a VLM. Prompt: "Describe this advertisement image/video. What product/service is shown? What is the visual style, mood, and color palette? Extract any key text."

Embed the resulting text description.

Store description/embedding in vector store (source_type: 'creative_description').

Phase 2: Retrieval Logic (Backend - In openai.ts flow before calling OpenAI Chat API)

Trigger: When streamChatCompletion in openai.ts is called with a new user message.

Identify Need for Context: Analyze the user's message. Does it ask to create something, ask for suggestions, require brand knowledge, or discuss products/strategy? (e.g., "create a campaign", "suggest ad copy", "help me target users for my leather bags", "what was my goal again?").

Fetch Structured Data: Query standard PostgreSQL tables for the userId to get: business_name, website_url, primary_advertising_goal, connected platform IDs, logo_url, brand_colors, brand_voice_tags, target_cpa/roas, etc.

Perform Semantic Search (If Context Needed):

Embed User Query: Generate an embedding for the current user message using the same OpenAI model used in Phase 1.

Query Vector Store: Search the vector store for vectors associated with the userId that are most similar (e.g., using cosine similarity) to the user query embedding. Retrieve the top N (e.g., 3-5) relevant text chunks (text_chunk) and their source_type.

Retrieve Associated Data: If relevant image/logo descriptions were retrieved, also fetch their corresponding image URLs from the standard Postgres DB.

Phase 3: Augmentation (Backend - In openai.ts flow, constructing the prompt)

Combine Context: Gather the structured data (from Step 3) and the unstructured text snippets/descriptions (from Step 4).

Build Prompt for Chat LLM: Construct the messages array to be sent to the OpenAI Chat API (gpt-4o in your code). Inject the retrieved context into the system prompt or as a preceding "context" message.

Example Structure within streamChatCompletion before openaiClient.chat.completions.create:

// ... inside streamChatCompletion ...

// 1. Fetch structured data (pseudo-code)
const structuredData = await storage.getBusinessInfo(userId);
const brandIdentity = await storage.getBrandIdentity(userId);
// ... fetch other relevant structured data

let retrievedRagContext = "";
// 2. Check if RAG context is needed based on userMessage.content
if (/* logic to determine if context is needed */) {
    // 3. Embed user query (pseudo-code)
    const queryEmbedding = await generateOpenAIEmbedding(userMessage.content);

    // 4. Query Vector Store (pseudo-code - depends on your chosen store)
    const relevantChunks = await vectorStore.searchSimilar(userId, queryEmbedding, 5);

    // 5. Format RAG context
    retrievedRagContext = `
--- Retrieved Context for User ${userId} ---
Business Name: ${structuredData.businessName}
Primary Goal: ${structuredData.primaryGoal}
Website: ${structuredData.websiteUrl}
Brand Colors: ${brandIdentity.colors.join(', ')}
Brand Tone: ${brandIdentity.tones.join(', ')}
Logo URL: ${brandIdentity.logoUrl}
Target ROAS: ${structuredData.targetRoas || 'Not Set'}
Relevant Info Snippets:
${relevantChunks.map(chunk => `- (${chunk.source_type}): ${chunk.text_chunk.substring(0, 150)}...`).join('\n')}
--- End Retrieved Context ---
`;
}

// 6. Construct final messages for OpenAI
const systemPromptContent = cleanSystemPrompt(systemPrompt); // Your existing system prompt
const fullMessages: ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
    {
        role: "system",
        // Inject RAG context into the system prompt or as a separate message
        content: systemPromptContent + "\n\n" + retrievedRagContext
    },
    // Spread the rest of the processed messages (user, previous assistant, tool)
    ...processedMessages // Assuming 'processedMessages' holds the history + current user message
];

// 7. Call OpenAI API
const completion = await openaiClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: fullMessages,
    tools: toolsFormatted,
    // ... rest of your parameters
});

// ... rest of your streaming and tool handling logic ...


Phase 4: Generation (Chat LLM - openai.ts)

LLM Processing: The Chat LLM (gpt-4o) receives the prompt augmented with both structured facts and semantically relevant unstructured text snippets.

Informed Response: It uses this richer context to generate more accurate, personalized, and helpful responses, including better suggestions for campaign creation, ad copy, targeting, and answering qualitative questions. It can reference the business details naturally.

How this interacts with sqlBuilder.ts:

The RAG context primarily informs the Chat LLM.

When the user asks a data query (e.g., "How did my summer campaign perform last week?"), the Chat LLM might use its general context, but the core task is handed off.

Your application logic (likely within the handleFunctionCall or similar routing mechanism) would detect this is a data query (using sqlBuilder.isDataQuery).

It then calls sqlBuilder.processSQLQuery, passing the user's raw data question and potentially specific, relevant snippets from the chat history (like mentioned campaign IDs or date ranges), but not the broad RAG context (website text, etc.).

The SQL Builder does its job, returns SQL/data, and the Chat LLM presents this data back to the user, potentially adding narrative using its broader context.

5. Example Marketing & Ad Campaign Questions (and how RAG helps the Chat LLM)

Campaign Creation:

"Help me set up a Google Search campaign for my new line of sustainable dog toys."

RAG Helps: Retrieves product description ("sustainable dog toys", "eco-friendly materials"), website text (brand mission), brand tone ("friendly", "eco-conscious"). LLM suggests relevant keywords, ad copy reflecting sustainability, and confirms the goal (likely Sales or Traffic).

"Create an Amazon SP campaign for my bestsellers." (Assuming 'bestsellers' isn't explicitly listed in structured data).

RAG Helps: Retrieves website sections/product descriptions potentially highlighting popular items or categories. LLM can ask "Based on your site, it looks like [Product X] and [Product Y] are popular. Shall we focus the campaign there?"

Creative & Copy:

"Suggest some ad headlines for a Facebook campaign targeting new parents."

RAG Helps: Retrieves brand tone ("playful", "reassuring"), key selling points ("organic materials", "safety tested"), product descriptions ("baby clothes", "nursery furniture"). LLM generates copy matching the tone and highlighting relevant features for that audience.

"What kind of images should I use for my brand?"

RAG Helps: Retrieves logo description ("minimalist, clean lines"), creative descriptions ("lifestyle shots, warm lighting"), brand tone ("professional"). LLM suggests image styles ("Use clean product shots and warm lifestyle photos featuring families, avoiding overly cluttered scenes").

Targeting & Strategy:

"Who should I target for my project management software?"

RAG Helps: Retrieves website text ("collaboration tool for remote teams", "integrates with Slack and Jira"), product description ("ideal for small to medium businesses"). LLM suggests targeting ("Target users interested in remote work tools, project management methodologies, and potentially job titles like 'Project Manager' or 'Team Lead' in SMBs").

"What's the best goal for advertising my online courses?"

RAG Helps: Retrieves primary goal selected in onboarding ("Lead Generation"), website text ("Download our free guide", "Sign up for a webinar"). LLM confirms the Lead Gen goal and suggests campaign types suited for it.

Analysis & Contextual Understanding:

User: "My main campaign isn't doing well." LLM: "Okay, I see your primary goal is 'Online Sales' and you sell [Product from description]. Can you tell me which campaign ID you're referring to, or I can look up performance data for campaigns related to [Product]?"

RAG Helps: Provides the product context for the LLM to frame its clarifying question.

User: "Remind me of my key selling points."

RAG Helps: Directly retrieves the embedded key_selling_points text provided during onboarding.

By implementing RAG this way, you significantly enhance the contextual awareness and capabilities of your primary Chat LLM, making it a much more effective assistant, while keeping the specialized SQL Builder focused on its core task. Remember to choose and set up your vector store as the first critical step.
